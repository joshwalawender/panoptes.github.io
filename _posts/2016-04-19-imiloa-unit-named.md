# ‘Imiloa Unit Gets a Name

**Nanea**: Of absorbing interest, interesting; fascinating.

PANOPTES unit `PAN004`, set up as a demonstration unit at ‘Imiloa in Hawai‘i, received a new name this last week from a foster grandparent at Keaukaha Elementary and we couldn't agree more with the name. Ms. Paulette Ke, who grew up on the Big Island of Hawai‘i and was attending ‘Imiloa's 10th birthday celebration event with her foster classrom, said that the name Nanea occurred to her immediately. Thanks to Ms. Ke for our first personalized unit!
