# Building a PANOPTES Unit

{% include note.html text="The baseline design is meant to be assembled by anyone with a basic knowledge of electronics, computers, and astronomy, and a taste for building things/tinkering. There is no need to machine parts, and only standard tools are required (you will need a drill, screwdrivers, voltmeter). All electronics are readily available, and only need to be mounted and wired together. <br> <br> Please note, however, that some components do require the use of basic hand tools and electrical wiring. Always use caution when dealing directly with a PANOPTES unit." %}


## PANOPTES Build Instructions

The instructions linked below are still in development and should be considered to be at a beta level of readiness.  We will be updating these constantly as we build units and get feedback from the first generation of builders.  Please <a href="mailto:info@projectpanoptes.org">Contact Us</a> if you would like to build a unit and we will help you decide how to proceed.
