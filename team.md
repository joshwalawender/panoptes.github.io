The core PANOPTES team who participated in the development of the prototype and baseline units are:

{% include thumbnail.html src="people/OlivierGuyon.png" align="left" heading="Olivier Guyon" caption="Olivier is an astronomer at the Subaru Telescope and the University of Arizona. Olivier started astronomy as an avid amateur astronomer at age 10, and enjoys building and using telescopes for amateur astronomy. His professional interest in exoplanets and his taste for amateur astronomy and astrophotography led him and other like-minded amateur/professional astronomers to start the PANOPTES project. Olivier's professional website describes his exoplanet instrumentation work: coronagraphy, adaptive optics." %}

{% include thumbnail.html src="people/Wilfred.jpg" align="right" heading="Wilfred Tyler Gee" caption="Wilfred is a software developer who was tired of making money and decided he wanted to make science instead. Currently working on PANOPTES from Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia as part of his Masters Thesis, Wilfred recently attained a bachelors degree in Astronomy from the University of Hawaii at Hilo. His previous bachelors was from the University of Utah in Psychology. Wilfred is also a wanna-be Shakespearean actor and, in his free time, likes to rapel down waterfalls." %}

The stars and exoplanets PANOPTES is observing feel like unusually nearby targets for Kathy. Some have suggested that Kathy hopes PANOPTES will help prove that cats have colonized other planets."}
